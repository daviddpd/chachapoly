You lit the fire
Then drank the water
You slammed that door and left me standing all alone
We wrote the story
We turned the pages
You changed the end like everybody said you would
I should have seen it coming
It should have sent me running
That's what I get for loving you
If I had a time machine and
If life was a movie scene
I'd rewind and I'd tell me run
We were never meant to be
So if I had a time machine
I'd go back and I'd tell me run run
